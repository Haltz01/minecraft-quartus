# Minecraft as Nether before!
Withery is a (currently WIP) mod that aims to overhaul wither-related stuff in the game, giving them a deeper meaning.

I plan to add tons of things to the game, but some of my ideas are just concepts. Here's a draft of what I'm planning to cover:
<ul>
<li>Wither effect as a life balance mechanic</li>
<li>Mob generation using plant essences</li>
<li>New Wither mobs</li>
<li>Piglin lore</li>
</ul>

I owe Fabric Discord's people for making this possible! I respect a lot how supportive they are whenever I send a question in #mod-dev. I also owe FabricMC team for making this astounding Modding API and its wiki, you guys deserve all my praise.
